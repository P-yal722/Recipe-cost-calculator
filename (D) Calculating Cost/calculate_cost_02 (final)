# Here we are calculating the cost of our ingredients. We are doing this by using our previous variables: (cost/amount per pacage) * amount needed
# The for loop helps run through each of the values in our costs list and divide it with the corresponding value from the amounts_per_package list and then multiply it with the corresponding value from the amount_ingredients list
